# Programming Practical Week 6 
## Formative Groupwork Peer Review

### Interest of content
**Excellent**
This group wrote in detail about a variety of interesting topics such as financial technology.

### Consistency and quality of visual presentation
**Excellent**
Each page is thematically consistent, with headlined paragraphs towards the left side and multiple images arranged vertically towards the right side. They have used a simple monochrome colour scheme which could be considered a bit bland and the website would look better if the jumbotron font matched the font used for all other text.
