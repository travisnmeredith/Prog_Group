# Programming Practical Week 6 
## Formative Groupwork Peer Review

### Interest of content
**Excellent**

This group wrote in detail about a variety of interesting topics such as financial technology.

### Consistency and quality of visual presentation
**Very good**

Each page is thematically consistent, with headlined paragraphs towards the left side and multiple images arranged vertically towards the right side. They have used a simple monochrome colour scheme which could be considered a bit bland and the website would look better if the jumbotron font matched the font used for all other text.

### Quality of written presentation
**Excellent**

The quality of the writing is generally good and there was only a single typing error. Each page is easy to read with clear paragraphing and some bullet-pointed lists.

### Validity of HTML
**Outstanding**

Aside from a single navbar item not linking to anything, all HTML on the website works perfectly fine.

### Evidence of collaboration
**Acceptable**

Out of the three individual web pages, excluding the home page, only one has an author bio written - though this was by another group member.
There seems to be lots of contributions from three of the group members, though one has not contributed at all.
Although there was commits made close to the time of the practical, the group has consistently worked on their website over the past week.
